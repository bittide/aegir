# bittide simulation

The platform crate supports bittide functional simulation.
It allows the definition of topologies (hardware system or
application). Topologies are graphs of nodes connected by links.

There are generic traits (NodeSpec and LinkSpec) that define the interfaces
available for nodes and links.

There are several modules, see the Rust generated documentation (or the
comments in the code) for explanations of their functionality.
